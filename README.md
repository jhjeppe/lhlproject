    In this project, you will create a report that includes details and information about the devices in your Lab environment. You will use Nmap and Wireshark to discover details about     each device, confirm your discovered information by double-checking it on the devices themselves, and then create network documentation to support your discoveries. To support your     findings, you will also document how and where you found the information you include in your documentation.

2. [Risks and Vulnerabilities](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1WmE9PYq7hda3vqpAPaaSXmiB6_4wpmnP/view?usp=sharing)

    In this project, you will create a report that gives recommendations on sensors that should be monitored, associating the sensor with well known IoCs for the organization in the case study. The report explains what sensors should be used, prioritizing them and connecting them to IoCs, threats and vulnerabilities. It specifies what alert thresholds need to be set and why.
